abstract = {Energy poverty is defined as the inability to afford to heat the home to an adequate temperature at reasonable cost. Such a concept has gained political recognition in an increasing number of countries; however, in the United Kingdom, related policies tend to rely upon measures of general deprivation as a practical proxy. This has often resulted in the design of sub-optimal schemes for eradicating this issue. After engaging with the debate about the independence of the energy poverty concept, this paper evaluates the relationship between energy poverty and multi-dimensional measures of deprivation through a statistical analysis. Findings demonstrate that energy poverty constitutes an additional and independent form of deprivation, which is not captured by the current English Index of Deprivation. Also, results are utilised to develop a classification matrix that identifies areas by their level of deprivation and energy poverty that can be mapped through a Geographic Information System at a Lower Super Output Area. The resultant maps can be utilised to develop effective local area interventions focused on the factors that are most likely to reduce energy poverty in that geography.}
